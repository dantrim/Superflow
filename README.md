# Superflow
... where 'SusyNtuple' is a doing word

## Pre-Requisites

**Superflow** is a package that analyzes susyNt so it is assumed that the **SusyNtuple** package is already checked out in your working directory. 
If you do not yet have a SusyNtuple-ready working area, go to [susynt-read](https://github.com/susynt/susynt-read/tree/mc15) and follow the
directions in the README for getting set-up to read the SusyNt from your needed producation tag.
